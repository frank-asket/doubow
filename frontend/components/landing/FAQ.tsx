    q: "What is Doubow?",
    a: "Doubow is the platform for people who want their next opportunity—whether that's a dream job or a more professional launchpad for entrepreneurship. You build a real profile (résumé, certifications, saved roles or leads), and we automate tailored drafts, pipeline tracking, and interview prep. You always apply or send on official channels yourself; with Gmail connected, we can create drafts you finish and send.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use Doubow if I'm starting a business, not only applying to jobs?",
    a: "Yes. Many members use the same workspace to keep their story consistent: clear pitch-style wording from their background, organized \"opportunities\" they add manually (programs, clients, roles), and professional drafts they edit before sending. Doubow isn't legal, tax, or fundraising advice—but it helps you show up credibly while you build.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Doubow create a different resume for every job?",
    a: "Doubow helps you produce job-specific materials (for example tailored bullets and letters) aligned to what each posting emphasizes. You can adjust everything before you use it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Gmail work?",
    a: "If you connect Google, Doubow can create email drafts in your Gmail account so you can edit and send from your own address. Doubow does not send mail automatically.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Doubow apply for me?",
    a: "No—and that’s intentional. Doubow prepares materials and drafts; you submit on the employer or LinkedIn site yourself (you still click Apply). That protects your accounts and matches how hiring is meant to work.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Doubow a “digital twin” that talks to recruiters for me?",
    a: "No. Doubow is a private workspace: the assistant helps you prepare and organize from your real résumé and credentials—you review everything. There is no public chatbot that represents you to employers unless you build something like that outside Doubow.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I export my saved jobs?",
    a: "Yes. On My jobs, use Export CSV to download a spreadsheet you can open in Excel or Google Sheets for your own tracking.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast is it?",
    a: "Generating suggestions usually takes about a minute, depending on load and your connection.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data secure?",
    a: "We design for encrypted storage where it matters, limited logging, and narrow permissions when you connect email. Details belong in Doubow’s privacy policy.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to verify identity?",
    a: "Your Doubow sign-in handles your account. Employers may run their own background or credential checks separately.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which countries and job types are supported?",
    a: "You can use Doubow wherever you are searching. Quality depends on the roles and text you bring—paste job ads, add links, and refine your country or field in Discover for better suggestions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use Doubow on mobile?",
    a: "The dashboard works on phones and tablets; long application forms on employer sites are often easier on a computer.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the usage limits?",
    a: "Free and paid plans differ in how many jobs and AI assists you can use each month. Check the pricing page for current tiers.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I contact support?",
    a: "Email on Free; priority support on paid plans where offered.",
  },
